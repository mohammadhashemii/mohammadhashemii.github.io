I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science](https://cs.emory.edu/home/) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), advised by Prof. [Andreas Zufle](https://www.zuefle.org/) at the [Spatial Computing Lab](https://spatial.cs.emory.edu/). My current research focuses on designing novel spatio-temporal foundation models for understanding human mobility using geolocation data.

Previously, I had the opportunity to work on a rotation project with Prof. [Li Xiong](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~lxiong/), where we developed privacy-preserving predictive models for multi-modal temporal Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. I also worked under the supervision of Dr. [Wei Jin](http://www.cs.emory.edu/~wjin30//) on designing scalable and explainable graph condensation methods for Graph Neural Networks.

My broader research interests lie in machine learning, with applications in spatio-temporal computing, graph learning, and computer vision. I am particularly interested in gaining a principled understanding of these methods by exploring their mathematical foundations and real-world implications. My long-term goal is to translate this theoretical insight into practical solutions for real-world challenges.
