I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://cs.emory.edu/home/) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). Currently, I am working on Graph Neural Networks including their theory foundation, model robustness, and applications under the supervision of Dr. [Wei Jin](http://www.cs.emory.edu/~wjin30//).

My research interests include **Deep Learning** in particular, and **Machine Learning** in general, with applications in **Graph Learning**, and **Computer Vision**. I am intended to better understand these methods in a principled manner by investigating their underlying mathematics and their practical implications in real life. My research goal is to channel such better theoretical and functional understanding of these new methods towards better practical solutions for real life problems.

## Research Interests

- Graph Neural Networks, Graph Machine Learning
- Computer Vision
- AI in Healthcare

## Education

- Ph.D. in Computer Science, Emory University, 2023 - Present
- B.Sc. in Computer Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, 2018 - 2023
